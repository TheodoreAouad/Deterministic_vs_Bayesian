# BayesianFewShotExperiments

The code is decomposed into two main modules: `src/` and `scripts/`. The directory `src/` contains the core of the code: the managing of datasets, the definition of models, the uncertainty computation and the training and evaluating tasks. It is sufficient to use our work in practice and for further research. The directory `scripts/` contains the scripts used to generate the figures obtained after having trained our models.
